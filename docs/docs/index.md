# Quick start

Let's discover **RooSpawn in less than 5 minutes**.

## Prerequisites

This quick-start tutorial assumes an opened VSCode workspace pointing to a Git repository
with clean working directory (no uncommitted changes and no untracked files).

## Install and configure Roo-Code extension

Roo-Code is a VSCode AI agent that can help you write code.

See [Quick Start](https://docs.roocode.com/#quick-start) for Roo-Code installation and configuration instructions.

:::note

Should we "inline" the Roo-Code installation and configuration instructions here?

:::

## Install RooSpawn extension

Open command palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) and run:

```
ext install roospawn.roospawn
```

## Create a new RooSpawn notebook

RooSpawn is controlled via a Python code run in a special notebook.

To create a new notebook, use (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) **RooSpawn: New notebook** command.

## Run the notebook

Simply use the "**Run all**" button and watch RooSpawn does the work for you.
